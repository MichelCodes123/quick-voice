## Motivations
I had been looking to learn SQL and how to use a DBMS, so I thought a project would be the best place to start.

## How to run the project.
1. Install Go
> https://go.dev/dl/

2. Install PostgresSQL and setup a local database
> https://www.postgresql.org/download/

3. Clone this repository.

4. In the project directory, run `go run .` from the terminal
